# LaunchDarkly sample Python application

We've built a simple console application that demonstrates how LaunchDarkly's SDK works.

Below, you'll find the build procedure. For more comprehensive instructions, you can visit your [Quickstart page](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/ai-configs/quickstart) or the [Python reference guide](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/sdk/ai/python).

This demo requires Python 3.8 or higher.

## Build Instructions

This repository includes examples for `OpenAI` and `Bedrock`. Depending on your preferred provider, you may have to take some additional steps.

### General setup

1. Set the environment variable `LAUNCHDARKLY_SDK_KEY` to your LaunchDarkly SDK key. If there is an existing an AI Config in your LaunchDarkly project that you want to evaluate, set `LAUNCHDARKLY_AI_CONFIG_KEY` to the flag key; otherwise, an AI Config of `sample-ai-config` will be assumed.

   ```bash
   export LAUNCHDARKLY_SDK_KEY="1234567890abcdef"
   export LAUNCHDARKLY_AI_CONFIG_KEY="sample-ai-config"
   ```

1. Ensure you have [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) installed.

### OpenAI setup

1. Install the required dependencies with `poetry install -E openai` or `poetry install --all-extras`.
1. Set the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` to your OpenAI key.
1. On the command line, run `poetry run openai-example`.

### Bedrock setup

1. Install the required dependencies with `poetry install -E bedrock` or `poetry install --all-extras`.
1. Ensure the required AWS credentials can be [auto-detected by the `boto3` library](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/credentials.html). Examples might include environment variables, role providers, or shared credential files.
1. On the command line, run `poetry run bedrock-example`.
