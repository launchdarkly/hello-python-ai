# LaunchDarkly sample Python application

We've built a simple console application that demonstrates how LaunchDarkly's SDK works.

Below, you'll find the build procedure. For more comprehensive instructions, you can visit your [Quickstart page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/quickstart#/) or the [Python reference guide](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/sdk/server-side/python).

This demo requires Python 3.8 or higher.

## Build Instructions

This repository contains two subdirectories. Depending on the provider you use, you can run the example under `openai` or `bedrock`.
